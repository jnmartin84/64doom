At long last, the full source + ROM building toolkit release of 64Doom, the best DOOM source port for the Nintendo 64, ever.

"src" directory contains all C source, header files and the Makefile used to build them into a .bin file.
"tools" directory contains the contents of the "MAKE YOUR OWN 64DOOM ROM" toolkit, used to turn that .bin file
  (and user-provided .WAD files) into a working .Z64 file for use with 64Drive/Everdrive64 or MESS (emulators, yuck).
64DOOM_README.TXT is this file
"doc" directory contains many text files including
  ORIGINAL_README.TXT is the original README.TXT from the 1990s DOOM open source release
  DOOMLIC.TXT is the DOOM open source license documentation
  CREDITS.TXT which provides attribution for various components and code contributors
  LICENSE_generic-hashtable.TXT, README_generic-hashtable.TXT required attribution for Hashtable implementation used
  GPLV3.TXT is a copy of the GPL V3 License as required


Thanks.
